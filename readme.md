<h1>Social Media Links Challenge</h1>

<p>This is my first challenge from <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io" target="_blank">frontendmentor</a>, the idea of this challenge is 
  to build out this social links profile and get it looking as close to the design as possible.</p>
  
  <br>

<h2>Licence Design</h2>
  
<p>I did not design this template, I simply transfromed the provided Image file into functional webpage using HTML 
  & CSS, and this is <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ" target="_blank">the desgin link</a></p>
