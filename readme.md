<h1>Social Media Links Challenge</h1>

<p>This is my first challenge from <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io" target="_blank">frontendmentor</a>, the idea of this challenge is 
  to build out this social links profile and get it looking as close to the design as possible.</p>
  
  <br>

<h2>Licence Design</h2>
  
<p>I did not design this template, I simply transfromed the provided Image file into functional webpage using HTML 
  & CSS, and this is <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ" target="_blank">the desgin link</a></p>

<h3>Demo</h3>

<h3>what i learned</h3>

<p>There are two best ways to center elements inside `body` via css :</p>

<h4>Flex Box</h4>

```css
body {
display: flex; 
justify-content : center; 
align-items : center; 
min-height: 100vh;
}
```

<h4>Grid</h4>

```css
body {
display: grid;
place-items: center;
min-height: 100vh;
}
```

- `min-height: 100vh;` is just to get full-screen (full page). we can use also `height: 100vh` if the content is short.

<p>I recommend focusing on learning either the grid or flexbox method. Mastering one of them will make you feel much more confident and comfortable moving forward.</p>
